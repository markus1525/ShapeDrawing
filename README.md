# ShapeDrawing Project

## Learning Outcomes

### Option 1: Fundamental (up to 15 marks)
The Unit Learning Outcomes (ULOs) include:
- **1.1** Explaining the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **1.2** Using OOP and associated .NET and SplashKit class libraries, including file content manipulation, user keyboard interaction, and shape drawing classes.
- **1.3** Developing and testing a custom SplashKit program using Visual Studio Code.

### Option 2: Intermediate (up to 18 marks)
This option extends Option 1 and includes the following additional ULOs:
- **2.1** Design new drawing classes that respond to various user keyboard interactions.
- **2.2** Construct appropriate UML class and sequence diagrams to communicate and describe your custom project.

---

## Engagement and Submission Requirements

### Option 1 and Option 2
- You must have **at least one in-person check-in** discussion with your allocated lab instructor during **Week 9, Week 10, or Week 11**—either in a helpdesk session or during lab time. This check-in is to discuss your implementation progress and receive feedback.
- **Failure to complete the check-in** will result in an interview with a panel in Week 14. The panel will determine your grade based on your interview performance.
- **Final submission**, including source code and a video demonstration, is due in **Week 13**.
- If completing **Option 2**, you must also submit a **report** containing your UML class diagram and at least one sequence diagram describing your implementation.

---

## Marking Criteria

### Option 1
Marks will be based on:
- Number of features implemented
- Correctness of the source code
- Clarity of the video demonstration

**Note:** Failure to submit both the source code and video demonstration will result in a mark of zero.

### Option 2
Marks will be based on:
- Number of features implemented
- Correctness of the source code
- Clarity of the video demonstration
- Quality of the report

**Note:** Failure to submit both the source code and video demonstration will result in a mark of zero.

## Specifications

### Option 1: Fundamental Custom Program (15 marks)

This program continues the ShapeDrawing program developed in Week 7 by adding the following three features:

#### Feature 1: Random Shapes
Allow the end-user to press a key that will simultaneously draw a **random number of different shape types**—including rectangles, circles, and lines—onto the canvas.
- You may choose which key to use
- Shapes should appear at random locations with random colors
- Other attributes such as width/height (rectangles), radius (circles), or length (lines) can be hard-coded

#### Feature 2: Draw First Letter of Name
Allow the end-user to press a key that will automatically draw the **first letter of your first name** on the canvas.
- You may choose which key to use, but it must be different from any keys already used in your existing ShapeDrawing program
- You may use lines, rectangles, circles, or a combination of these shapes to form the letter in a clear and visible way

#### Feature 3: Change Colors
Allow the end-user to press a key that will automatically **change the colors of all shapes** on the canvas to random colors.

#### Important Notes
- Existing functionalities from Week 7 must be preserved—specifically, the ability to **save and load shapes** to and from a file
- Create a video recording to demonstrate the features you have developed and explain your source code
- At the beginning of the video, please clearly state your **name and student ID**

#### Submission Details
- Source Code
- Video Recording for Demonstration
- **Deadline:** Week 13
- Submission link will be available on Canvas under Assignment section

**Note:** Attempting Option 1 does not guarantee 15 marks by default. It depends on your source code correctness, video demonstration performance, and academic integrity.

### Option 2: Intermediate Custom Program (18 marks)

This program continues the ShapeDrawing program developed in Week 7 by adding the following three features:

#### Feature 1: Random Shapes
Allow the end-user to press a key that will simultaneously draw a **random number of different shape types**—such as rectangles, circles, and lines—onto the canvas.
- You may choose which key to use
- Shapes should appear at random locations with random colors
- Other attributes—such as width/height for rectangles, radius for circles, and length for lines—can be hard-coded

#### Feature 2: Draw Full First Name
Allow the end-user to press a key that will automatically draw **your first name** on the canvas.
- You may choose which key to use, but it must be different from any keys used in your existing ShapeDrawing program
- You can use lines, rectangles, circles, or a combination of these shapes to make your name clear and visually distinct

#### Feature 3: Scale Down All Shapes
Allow the end-user to press a key that will automatically **scale down the size of all available shapes** on the canvas.
- For example, reducing the width and height, radius, or length

#### Important Notes
- Existing functionalities from Week 7 must be preserved—specifically, **saving and loading shapes** to and from a file
- Create a video recording to demonstrate the functionalities you have developed and explain your source code
- At the beginning of the video, please clearly display your **name and student ID**
- Prepare a **report** that includes a UML class diagram and a sequence diagram
- The diagrams should illustrate how objects collaborate and interact to achieve either the **second or third feature**

#### Submission Details
- Source Code
- Demonstration Recording
- UML Report
- **Deadline:** Week 13
- Submission link will be available on Canvas under Assignment section

**Note:** Attempting Option 2 does not guarantee 15-18 marks by default. It depends on your source code correctness, video demonstration performance, the report's quality, and academic integrity.

## Additional Features

Beyond the required features for Options 1 and 2, this program includes the following enhancements:

#### Scale Up All Shapes (U Key)
Press the **U** key to scale up all shapes currently on the canvas. This feature complements the scale down functionality from Option 2, allowing users to increase the size of all shapes (width, height, radius, or length) simultaneously.

#### Select All Shapes (A Key)
Press the **A** key to select all shapes currently on the canvas at once. This provides a convenient way to select multiple shapes without having to individually right-click on each one, making it easier to perform batch operations like deletion.
